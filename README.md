- 👋 Hi, I’m @VBoB13
- 👀 I’m interested in projects that is related to either education or healthcare. Especially B2C service platforms that have a different yet modern & updated approach towards already existing solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (Django, Django REST Framework, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6 + ReactJS).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects similar to what's described above.
- 📫 How to reach me: here on GitHub? Let's at least start here :)
